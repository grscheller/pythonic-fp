"""
Pythonic Functional Programming Libraries
=========================================

The overall effort's name is
`Pythonic FP <https://pypi.org/project/pythonic-fp/>`_.
It consists of Python projects whose names on PyPI and GitHub
all begin with *"python-fp-"*. Each project implements a top-level
package in the ``pythonic_fp`` Python namespace.

**Goals:**

- assist in a functional style of programming in Python
- support both stateful and functional programming styles
- be extensible, type safe, and efficient
- threadsafe when practical, thread tolerant otherwise
- fulling support typing tools like `mypy <https://mypy-lang.org/>`_
- have good documentation
- be pythonic

**Non-Goals:**

- try and make Python a pure functional language
- implement a functional domain specific language in Python
- force users to adopt unpythonic cryptic coding styles
