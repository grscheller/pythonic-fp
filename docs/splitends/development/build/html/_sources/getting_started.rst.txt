Getting Started
===============

How to installing the package
-----------------------------

Install the project into your Python environment:

.. code:: console

   $ pip install pythonic-fp.splitends

Importing the module
--------------------

Importing the SplitEnd class into your code.

.. code:: python

   from pythonic_fp.splitends.splitend import SplitEnd

.. Note::

   Module splitends.splitend_node is an implementation detail for
   the SplitEnd class. It should not be imported. It is kept "public" 
   since it could be useful if one were to implement another data
   structures similar to a SplitEnd.
