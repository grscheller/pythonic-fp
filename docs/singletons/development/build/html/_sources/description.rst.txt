PyPI project
`pythonic-fp-singletons
<https://pypi.org/project/pythonic-fp-singletons/>`_
was renamed to
`pythonic-fp-sentinels
<https://pypi.org/project/pythonic-fp-sentinels/>`_.

Both part of the 
`pythonic-fp namespace projects
<https://github.com/grscheller/pythonic-fp/blob/main/README.md>`_.

Final PyPI release of pythonic-fp-singletons was the one and only v1.0.0 release.

Changes since v1.0.0 release
----------------------------

singletons.sbool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Module ``sbool`` was moved to its own package ``pythonic_fp.booleans`` and
completely reimplemented into modules ``subtypable_bool`` and ``flavored_bool``,
the first is a subtypable boolean-like type. The second type is a family of 
booleans of different "flavors" of truth where each flavor is a value of any
hashable type. Both can be used in Python shortcut logic. Both can use Python
bitwise operations to do non-shortcut boolean logic.

singletons.nada
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Module ``nada`` has been removed.

Though I learned a lot about Python getting it to work, I have abandoned the
class Nada effort.
    
- neat idea, but probably would never have used it
- trying to get __set__ method correct not worth the effort
- decided its use case was not worth the effort to maintain it

singletons.sentinel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extended class ``Sentinel`` from declaring distinct singletons with strings
to declaring them with any hashable type.
